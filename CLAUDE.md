# Coding Approach Instructions

## Core Principle
Write code that is as simple as possible while still being capable of completing the task at hand.

## Guidelines

### Simplicity First
- Use the most straightforward solution that works
- Avoid over-engineering or premature optimization
- Choose clarity over cleverness
- Prefer explicit over implicit code

### Code Style
- Use clear, descriptive variable and function names
- Minimize dependencies and external libraries
- Use standard library functions when available

### Implementation Strategy
- Start with the minimal working solution
- Add complexity only when necessary
- Test incrementally as you build
- Refactor only when code becomes unclear or repetitive

### Decision Making
- When multiple approaches exist, choose the simpler one
- Favor readability and maintainability over performance unless performance is critical
- Use well-established patterns and conventions
- Document complex logic with comments only when necessary

### Error Handling
- Handle errors at the appropriate level
- Use simple, clear error messages
- Fail fast when appropriate
- Don't catch errors you can't handle meaningfully

## Remember
The goal is working, understandable code that solves the problem efficiently without unnecessary complexity.
