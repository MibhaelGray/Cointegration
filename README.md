# Stock Basket Cointegration Analysis

## Project Overview

This project aims to identify a basket of stocks where each individual stock is cointegrated with the larger basket, enabling the detection of statistically meaningful price action divergences.

## Project Goals

The primary objective is to **identify when a stock's price action diverges from the basket's in a statistically meaningful way**. This approach differs from traditional pairs trading or statistical arbitrage strategies - instead, it focuses on:

- Building a cohesive basket of stocks with strong cointegration relationships
- Detecting when individual stocks break away from the basket's long-term equilibrium
- Providing statistical signals for potential divergence events

## Current Analysis

### Stock Universe
I want to try to focus on baskets of stocks similar to the ones below:

- Enterprise software (CRM, NOW, WDAY, HUBS)
- Cloud infrastructure (SNOW, NET, DDOG, CFLT)
- Development platforms (TEAM, GOOGL, META)
- Security companies (CRWD, ZS)
- And other tech/cloud companies
